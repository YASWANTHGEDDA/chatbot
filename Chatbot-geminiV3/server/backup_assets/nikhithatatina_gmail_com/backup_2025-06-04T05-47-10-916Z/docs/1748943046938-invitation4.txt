Dear [Her Name],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am the Secretary of the ACM Student Chapter at Sasi Institue of Technology & Engineering. We are organizing a TEDx event on [Event Date] with the theme "Tech . Grit . Grace", and we would be honored to have you as one of our esteemed speakers.

Your journey as a mother, homemaker, and influencer is truly inspiring. Balancing the responsibilities of a family while creating content, editing your own videos, and recently crossing 1 lakh followers is a testament to your dedication, creativity, and resilience. We believe your insights on "How a Mother and Homemaker Can Juggle Multiple Roles and Thrive as an Influencer" would resonate deeply with our audience and inspire them to pursue their passions while managing their responsibilities.

The event will be attended by 500+ students and faculty members, including participants from neighboring colleges. We would be delighted to host you at our campus and provide all necessary support to ensure a seamless experience.

Please let us know if you are available and interested in being part of this event. We would be happy to discuss further details, including the topic, format, and logistics, at your convenience.

Thank you for considering our invitation. We look forward to the possibility of collaborating with you and sharing your inspiring story with our community.

Warm regards,
